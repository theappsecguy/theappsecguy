Hi all and welcome to my page! This page contains links to my blog, repositories and references relating to anything and everything application security. As an application security professional, I want to share the knowledge I have learned and tools I have developed to help others succeed in the field. Whether you are new to application security or an application security guru, I hope that this page will provide some resources and tools to help us all learn and grow!

## About theappsecguy

Above all else, I am a Christian, Husband and Father. I am an application security professional with about 7 years of experience in application security and general cybersecurity. Before becoming an application security engineer, I did a few years of software development. I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science and currently hold a Network+, Security+, GWAPT and GSSP-Java certifications. In my free time, I enjoy boning up on my penetration testing skills, playing guitar, Netflix binging, attempting to keep my body in shape, enjoying a craft beer (especially if it is from Germany or an inspired German beer), and most importantly being with my family, friends and neighbors.
